# We use data from the US Census Bureau with the tidycensus and tigris packages,
# but they require personal API keys so we can't make this part super
# reproducible. Instead, we save these ACS and block group datasets as CSV files
# in "data/census/" and load them in the individual question scripts. We include
# the code here for the sake of reproducibility
